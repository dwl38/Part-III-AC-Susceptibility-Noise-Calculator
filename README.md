# Part-III-AC-Susceptibility-Noise-Calculator
A repository for my Part III Masters Project, on predicting noise in AC susceptibility measurements of nonlinear materials based on finite-element field analysis. This work was done as part of the Quantum Materials Group, Maxwell Centre, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge.
